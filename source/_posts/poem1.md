Chilled night, chilly light, <br>
Wind rolling sky, <br>
Cloud over head. <br>
Ashes tangled my hair, <br>
Mind lost from ear. <br>

Running from sunlight, <br>
The music ignite a fire, <br>
Lit a face in the dusky theater air; <br>
The dance stepped the melody <br>
Into my eyes gently. <br>
Tears shining <br> 
In the reflected screen light, <br>
Heart flipping <br> 
Over the woebegone rejoicing <br>
With the beauty of art. <br>
<br>
I've lost my blue <br>
From their bloody mouth. <br>
Taping up and down, <br>
Their tip of tongue fan a fame. <br>
When there is no longer a pure face <br>
But tech race on the screen, <br>
They stop looking into themselves. <br>
<br>
I've shut my soul from heat of lies, <br>
But lost in my chilling heart. <br>
Looking outside <br> 
From the window of fear, <br>
Everyone seems to be tired. <br>
Walking over again <br>
Like nothing changed there, <br>
I want my feeling back. <br>
